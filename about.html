                    <h2 class="title">About Us</h2>
                    <p id="design">Designing a space does not only require a visual approach,
                        but it is about the process of thinking itself, about
                        skills, aspects that helped us define as our professional goal the
                        improvement of the quality and reality of
                        our clients' lives through the projects we work on.
                        All interior design projects are based on understanding
                        the client, the one whose state of
                        mind is influenced by the environment in which he lives, works or engages
                        in relaxation activities. His ideas, requirements and wishes are
                        found in the project and are stylized and transformed
                        into functional, aesthetic ideas and are properly approached from a technical
                        point of view. When we "get to know"
                        a new workspace, we take the time to analyze and feel all its transformation
                        possibilities, we look carefully for the signs that indicate how much
                        potential there is for change for the better, and we try to find as many strong points as
                        possible
                        to start the concept. We believe that any defect or supposed minus can take a positive
                        form or can be enhanced by another element not identified until that moment. Situations also
                        happen during a project that are challenging for us as a designer and
                        this makes our work more dynamic, more exciting, helps us to surpass ourself and learn
                        continuously. We believe
                        that there is at least one solution for any potential problem.</p>
