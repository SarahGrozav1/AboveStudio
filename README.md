# Page Design

## Surface

The surface design of the website is a simple design , maintaining easy of readability. The color schemes and font were chosen accordingly.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme I choosed is inspired from pinterest, from mycolor.space which I know from Code Institute and from pictures that I chose to be for this site. I like the contrast from dark blue to white and yellow it gives me some luxury feeling.

![Color Scheme](documentation/color-scheme.png)

### Font

Arapey is the font used for high level heading such as the logo and menu links and lowerlevel headings use Ysabeau font. These fonts were chosen for the artistic character and to convey the fluency and flexibility of artistic experimentation.

## Technologies Used

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks & Tools
- GitHub
- VS Code
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome
- ColorSpace
- Pexels
- W3 Schools
- Youtube

## Testing and Validation

### HTML Validation

The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website. All pages passed with no errors or warnings.

### Accessibility & Performance

The Lighthouse feature on Google Devtools was used to assess accessibility and performance. All pages score high on accessibility. The gallery page scores lowest on performance due to the large number of images.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Gallery Page</summary>
<img src="documentation/lighthouse3.png" width="700">
</details>

## Outstanding Issues

When I tested Gallery page in HTML validation I haved an error because I used space between images name, I fixed with a short line between those two words.

## Browser Compatability

The websites compatability was tested on the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

## Room for improvement on User Stories

While all the minimum criteria for fullfilling the user stories are met, there are several items that could be improved upon:

1. A map could be included at the bottom of the home page to give more explicit directions to the location.

2. A section or a page where are prices so that posible clients to know  what to expect. 

## Bugs & Fixes

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Menu links failed on small screen sizes | Font size of logo and menu was decreased and menu floated left to fit header on two lines. |
| Images from Gallery Page was loading very hard | By compressing them I sized down their KB , making  them loading a little bit faster. | 



## Deployment & Development

### Version Control

The site was created using the GitHub editor.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.
